# MetaScrubber
An addon of sorts for mat2 which aims to make it possible to run mat2 on a whole directory instead of running it on individual files.
The goals of the project are as follows:
  1.0 Create a working script that allows for a user to simply input a target directory in order to run mat2 on every file in said directory.
  2.0 Add a feature that allows for a user to automatically generate a directory to drop files into (let's say we call this directory "Dirty"), run mat2 on all files in the directory and then have the files deposited into a new directory (let's call this directory "Clean") when scrubbed or yet another directory ("Error") if metadata could not be scrubbed.
  3.0 Incorporate a GUI of some sort in order to make this technology more accessible to the general public.
