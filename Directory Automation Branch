The intent of this branch is to add a feature that allows for a user to automatically generate a directory to drop files into (let's say we call this directory "Dirty"), run mat2 on all files in the directory and then have the files deposited into a new directory (let's call this directory "Clean") when scrubbed or yet another directory ("Error") if metadata could not be scrubbed.
The flow should look something like this:
1.) Automatically create a "Dirty" directory to place unscrubbed files into using drag and drop (or other gui based, non terminal methods).
2.) Automatically create a "Clean" directory that the program automatically deposits scrubbed files into.
  2.1)Write script that automatically moves scrubbed files into aforementioned "Clean" directory.
3.) Automatically create an "Error" directory that the program automatically deposits unsupported files into.
  3.1) Write a script that automatically moves files into aforementioned "Error" directory and continues the loop without causing an error code.
